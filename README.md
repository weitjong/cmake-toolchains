# cmake-toolchains

A collection of CMake toolchains for cross-compiling. The collection was originally developed as part of [Urho3D](https://urho3d.io/) project, a cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine, before being hosted separately here to cater for more general use case by other CMake-based projects.
